# LOOPWHILE

This is a bodged-together interpreter for an extended syntax I wrote for the LOOP and WHILE programming languages.
Most user-side documentation can be found at the link below (or /docs/index.html).
The Python file loopwile.py is from @cjquines.

The array data structure is potentially unstable; it hasn't  been tested as there is absolutely no need to use it.

Play with it at https://pihart.github.io/LOOPWHILE/.
